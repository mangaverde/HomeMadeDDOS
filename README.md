i'm new in python soo i think its a start.

To execute its kinda simple

-You will need a pormpt with pyton (i use anaconda prompt)

-donwload the python file

-Open the prompt and type this:

`
cd thediretorythereislocatedtarchive

python HomeMadeDDOSPoliceBrutalityLoL.py

`

and here we go now you need to put the ip and the pord you want attack

to find the ip of a website you can use this site:
